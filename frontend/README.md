    zkPass Schema for Binance User Verification
    zkPass is a privacy-preserving solution that enables secure sharing and verification of data without exposing sensitive information. Below are the Binance-related schemas you can use with zkPass to build decentralized applications:

    **A) Binance User Verification (bapi/accounts/v1/private/account/user/base-detail)**

    Verifies that the user has a Binance account. This can be used to confirm the user's identity while keeping personal data private.

    **B) Binance Transaction History (bapi/apex/v1/private/apex/marketing/user/sideBarStatus)**

    Allows verification of a userâ€™s transaction history on Binance. Useful for applications requiring proof of trading activity without revealing exact details.

    **C) Binance Loan Status (bapi/apex/v1/private/apex/marketing/user/sideBarStatus)**
    
    Checks if a user has active or past loans on Binance. Helps evaluate financial behavior while preserving confidentiality. Binance VIP Status

    **D) Confirms the userâ€™s Binance VIP level. (bapi/accounts/v1/private/vip/vip-portal/baseStatus)**
    
    Ideal for granting benefits or access based on the userâ€™s VIP tier. Binance Assets

    **E) Verifies the userâ€™s asset holdings on Binance. (bapi/asset/v2/private/asset-service/wallet/asset)**
    
    Ensures proof of asset ownership without exposing exact balances.
